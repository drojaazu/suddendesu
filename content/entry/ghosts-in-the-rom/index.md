This is a [fascinating older post made by the NYC Resistor group detailing the technical data behind the images left behind in the Apple Mac SE ROM<](http://www.nycresistor.com/2012/08/21/ghosts-in-the-rom/). As the ROM only used 89kB of the available 256kB, the original development digitized pictures of themselves and hid them away in the remaining space. The article goes into some interesting details about the image format and CPU opcodes.

Damian Ward has also posted some nice shots of the images on hardware: [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/damianward/3299284251), [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/damianward/3300112470), [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/damianward/3299283669) and [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/damianward/3300111824).
