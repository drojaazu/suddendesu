prep for 10 year anniversary

The name "SUDDEN DESU" came from the phrase "sudden death" used in many games to indicate a tie-breaker round. "Desu" is Japanese for "is," (kind of, sort of), but can also be the pronunciation for "death." It wasn't particularly witty, but I thought the name would stand out, I suppose. Anyway, naming this is hard.

On that note, SUDDEN DESU is not the name that I, the writer and researcher of most ofthe articles here, go by. The name I use online is Ryou, evolving from the much cringier RyogaMasaki from many, many years ago. Some of you with a history in the Sonic hacking/research scene circa 2001 to 2006 or so may recognize that name. Well, that was a long time ago...

the first versions of this blog began mid to late 2011-ish, hosted on tumblr. I posted about a variety of topics that matched my interests, including Japanese music and lyric translations, retro EPCOT Center photos, and, of course, research on old video games. It was yet another in a long line of personal websites I had designed, posted to, and subsequently got bored of over the years. But I felt like I really wanted to put a bit more effort into things this time, and I soon purchased a domain name which redireected to the tumblr blog.

I began to experiment with the tumblr api, writing a self-hosted front end that used tumblr as a backend. From there, I decided to move into a full-fledged CMS, and began to use bolt, which at the time was a lightweight and flexible solution. And so, in October 2014, I made my first post to the new, fully self hosted blog.

The intention wasn't to be video game focused at first, but instead to carry on as I had on tumblr, posting about whatever interested me. but it was around this time that I had discovered the MAME debugger, and not long after that, IDA Pro. As I stumbled upon bits of unused and hidden code, I realized this was a whole new frontier. Sure, console games had been hacked and researched for years, especially those in popular series like Sonic and Mario and Zelda and such. But arcade games seemed to be something that people weren't looking into. I had found a niche, one that I was enjoying greatly, and the rest is history.
