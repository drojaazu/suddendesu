SUDDEN DESU (the website) officially turns ten years old in October. My, how time flies...

<!--more-->

I'm a nostalgic person by nature, so I hope you'll allow me to wander and ramble a bit in this post. I'd like to talk a little bit about the site's history and, looking to the next ten years, its future.

# The Past

I'm currently 41 years old, due to be 42 in December, I hope. It's difficult to even imagine how things were just ten years ago. I think that's true for most people: we grow, priorities shift, circumstances change, and who we are a decade later is likely to be a whole new person.

Ten years ago, I was looking for a new project. I had already been out of the Sonic game hacking/research scene for a few years at that point. Not that I was ever a major player there, but I was known and had a (not always so great) reputation. But at that point there simply wasn't much left to do: I found myself uninterested in contemporary Sonic games and had little interest in researching them. This extended to other games of the time and, honestly, continues today.

(And to be clear, it was never a "new games suck lmao" kind of attitude. I have no doubt that there are many legitimately good modern games; I just had no interest in the style or content. It was always a "me" problem.)

I remained fascinated with the technical intricacies of older games, with adventuring into the data with a hex editor and some hardware documentation. I still loved reading about the history of a game's development, the business decisions, the gaming zeitgeist at the time. I didn't care too much to actually play the games, perhaps ironically, but I loved everything *about* retro video games.

So I decided to create another blog, the next in a long line of personal websites I'd developed over the years. (In most of those cases, the fun laid in the design than in actually writing content, so few stood the test of time.) This time, I would expand beyond the well-tread realm of Sonic the Hedgehog games, out of gaming as a whole, and blog about anything that I found interesting that related, at least tangentially, to old hardware and software, to emulation, to gaming culture of the past, and so on.

It started on tumblr, where I primarily reblogged relevant entries and posted interesting links with some commentary. I had chosen the name SUDDEN DESU more or less on a whim. It was derived from the phrase "sudden death," used in many games to indicate a tie-breaker round. "Desu" is Japanese for "is," (kind of, sort of), but can also be the pronunciation for the English word "death." At the time, I felt it was a good balance of being somewhat related to the content while also being unique and memorable. Maybe it would stand out.

(I actually dislike the name these days, but trying to pull a twitter and rebrand is just silly. It's fine.)



[prep for 10 year anniversary]


On that note, SUDDEN DESU is not the name that I, the writer and researcher of most ofthe articles here, go by. The name I use online is Ryou, evolving from the much cringier RyogaMasaki from many, many years ago. Some of you with a history in the Sonic hacking/research scene circa 1999 to 2006 or so may recognize that name. Well, that was a long time ago...

the first versions of this blog began mid to late 2011-ish, hosted on tumblr. I posted about a variety of topics that matched my interests, including Japanese music and lyric translations, retro EPCOT Center photos, and, of course, research on old video games. It was yet another in a long line of personal websites I had designed, half-heartedly posted to, and subsequently got bored of and abandoned over the years. But I felt like I really wanted to put a bit more effort into things this time, and I soon purchased a domain name which redireected to the tumblr blog.

I experimented with the tumblr api, writing a simple self-hosted front end that used tumblr as a backend. From there, I decided to move into a full-fledged CMS, and began to use Bolt, which at the time was a lightweight and flexible solution. And so, in October 2014, I made my first post to the new, fully self hosted blog.

The intention wasn't to be video game focused at first, but instead to carry on as I had on tumblr, posting about whatever interested me. but it was around this time that I had discovered the MAME debugger, and not long after that, IDA Pro. As I stumbled upon bits of unused and hidden code, I realized this was a whole new frontier. Sure, console games had been hacked and researched for years, especially those in popular series like Sonic and Mario and Zelda and such. But arcade games seemed to be something that people weren't looking into. I had found a niche, one that I was enjoying greatly, and the rest is history.
